Functionality to use your customer Admin Portal either based on this code or other with the integrated Nexfs Webserver will be added in a later Nexfs Release, or you can run it on a seperate web server configured to connect to the Nexfs API Service.   

Nexfs combines block, file, object & cloud storage, presenting an intelligent single multi-protocol supported feature-rich storage pool

As software-defined storage Nexfs offers flexibility, including the ability to configure and deploy storage systems your way; you choose the type of hardware, be that physical, virtual, cloud, or hybrid.

Nexfs supports up to three storage tiers. With the hottest data located on the highest performance tier, inactive data is relocated to cost-effective object or cloud storage.

Non written data blocks are thin provisioned; they do not consume physical storage or incur any storage cost. Optionally, Warm data can reside on a second storage tier.

Nexfs data migrations are transparent, occurring in the background, yielding the best performance to cost ratio for a file's data. No longer is the lifecycle of a file limited in its entirety.
